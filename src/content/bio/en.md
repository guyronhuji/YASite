**Dr. Yael Assor is a socio-cultural and medical anthropologist whose research investigates how culturally dependent moral frameworks shape health policy and healthcare decision tools, including cost-effectiveness analysis and notions of “objectivity” in bureaucratic practices. Her work draws on ethnographic fieldwork to explore how ethical assumptions influence resource allocation in national healthcare systems, with several articles in prominent peer-reviewed journals.**

**Dr. Assor has held postdoctoral fellowships supported by competitive grants and has been affiliated with institutions such as The Martin Buber Society of Fellows at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Safra Center for Ethics.**

**Beyond academia, she founded the Inter-Organizational Forum for Reducing Health Gaps in East Jerusalem, addressing disparities in community healthcare access.**
