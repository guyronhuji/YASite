title: Research services and paid lectures
---

I provide at-cost, short-term and project-based academic and policy services, including assessment studies, expert reviews, strategic planning, research support, and invited lectures.

My work focuses on healthcare policy, bioethics, and the cultural and moral dimensions of expertise, in Israel and internationally. Recent engagements include co-leading an assessment study for a physician-scientist position and contributing to the academic design of a workshop on feminism as political imagination at the Van Leer Institute.

If you are interested in exploring a possible collaboration or would like to discuss your needs, please feel free to contact me: [yaelassor@gmail.com](mailto:yaelassor@gmail.com)
